# Main Results

This directory reproduces the main results of the article. The directories are ordered similar to the workflow described in the article:
1. `01-material-selection`
2. `02-qeh-calculations`
3. `03-gap-equation`

By running all scripts in these directories, we reproduce the results, which are then analysed in the iPython Notebook `./02-qeh-calculations/02-qeh_analysis.ipynb` and the python script: ``.

Documentation to reproduce the results is provided in the ReadMe-files in each directory.
