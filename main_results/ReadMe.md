# Main Results

This directory reproduces the main results of the article. The directories are ordered similar to the workflow described in the article:
1. `01-material-selection`
2. `02-qeh-calculations`
3. `03-gap-equation`
The BiEx code package used to solve the gap equation is available from the authors upon reasonable request.

By running all scripts in these directories, we reproduce the results, which are then analysed in the Python files:
- `./02-qeh-calculations/02-qeh_analysis.ipynb`
- `./03-gap-equation/04_plot_gap_and_condensatefraction.py`
- `./03-gap-equation/05_gap_eq_heatmap.ipynb`.

Documentation to reproduce the results is provided in the ReadMe-files in each directory.
